## Get Started

### Frontends

Heseya provides a [Rest API](/developer/rest-api) that you can use to build a store in any form.
For creating online stores and hybrid applications in JS,
we recommend using an [SDK](/developer/js-sdk) that covers all API functions.

### Apps

Out platform allows you to create custom apps to add new functions, integrate with 3-party soft.
We do not limit the available features, the apps can even handle payments and 2fa verifications.

Just as with frontends, you can use any language you want when writing applications.
However, still the simplest way is to use the [JS SDK](/developer/js-sdk).
Also, we are in development of a set of tools to help facilitate development in PHP:
- [PHP SDK](https://github.com/heseya/sdk-php)
- [Laravel App Helper](https://github.com/heseya/app-helper)

### Dashboard

Heseya dashboard allows you to extend its features by adding micro-frontends and widgets.

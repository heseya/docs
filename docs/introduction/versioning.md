# Versioning

[[toc]]

Heseya and its other first-party services and packages follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
Minor and patch releases never contain breaking changes.

Additional designations for pre-release or extra builds are available
as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format extensions - For example: `4.0.0-rc1`
